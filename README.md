# DST Index Forecasting using ML Algorithms

Forecasting DST Index using Machine Learning
This project implements a machine learning model to forecast the DST (Disturbance Storm-Time) Index. The DST Index is a measure of the geomagnetic activity of the Earth's magnetic field, and it is used to study space weather phenomena. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
